# THE COHESION STUDY

## Introduction

As we are dealing with completely altered living conditions because of the pandemic, it is essential to understand how we are coping, today and in the coming months.  

The COHESION study, led by a team of researchers across Canada, evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on individuals like you, across the country. With data you provide by completing online surveys and installing a smartphone app, you help understand how daily activities, social interactions, and the mental health of Canadians are being affected throughout, and following, the pandemic.

Collected data will be anonymized and analyzed by a team of scientists. Results will be shared with decision makers and public health experts. It will guide and inform ongoing and future public health interventions for communities and individuals alike.
